# Requirements

**Project:** ScreenSort
**Version:** v1.0 (UX Improvements)
**Created:** 2026-01-30

## v1 Requirements

### Processing UX (PROC)

- [x] **PROC-01**: User sees immediate feedback when processing starts (no perceived freeze)
- [x] **PROC-02**: User sees progress indicator showing current/total screenshots during processing
- [x] **PROC-03**: User can cancel processing at any time during execution
- [x] **PROC-04**: Processing runs in background without blocking UI interactions

### Launch Experience (LAUNCH)

- [x] **LAUNCH-01**: User sees previous results list immediately on app launch (cached state)
- [x] **LAUNCH-02**: User sees skeleton/placeholder UI while fresh data loads
- [x] **LAUNCH-03**: App restores scroll position and view state from previous session

### Screenshot Organization (ORG)

- [x] **ORG-01**: Unknown/unclassifiable screenshots remain in original location (not moved)
- [x] **ORG-02**: Only successfully classified screenshots are moved to destination albums

### Persistence (PERSIST)

- [x] **PERSIST-01**: App tracks which screenshots have been processed
- [x] **PERSIST-02**: Previously processed screenshots are skipped on subsequent runs
- [x] **PERSIST-03**: Processing results are persisted between app launches
- [x] **PERSIST-04**: Cache invalidation when source screenshots are deleted

## v2 Requirements (Deferred)

- Offline mode for API lookups — requires significant caching infrastructure
- Batch correction UI — current single-item correction is sufficient
- Custom classification rules — hardcoded thresholds work for now
- Export to formats other than Google Docs — not requested
- Background processing when app is backgrounded — requires Background Tasks framework

## Out of Scope

- Undo for processed screenshots — complexity vs value tradeoff
- Manual album selection — automatic classification is core value
- iCloud sync of processing state — local-only is sufficient
- Notification when processing completes — app must be foregrounded

## Traceability
