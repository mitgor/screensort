# Milestone v1.0: UX Polish

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-30
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 8

## Overview

ScreenSort has working AI-powered screenshot classification but suffers from a critical UI freeze during processing. This milestone transforms the user experience from "app freezes for a minute" to "instant launch with smooth progress feedback." Four phases address the freeze bug, add progress indicators, implement persistence, and polish the launch experience.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Fix UI Freeze

**Goal**: Users can use the app normally while screenshots process in the background
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: PROC-01, PROC-03, PROC-04, ORG-01, ORG-02
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Move Vision OCR to background thread
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Add cancellation support, fix unknown handling, add cancel button

**Success Criteria:**
1. User can scroll the results list while processing runs
2. User can tap cancel and processing stops within 2 seconds
3. User sees immediate visual feedback when processing starts (no freeze)
4. Unknown/unclassifiable screenshots remain in their original album
5. Only successfully classified screenshots are moved to destination albums

### Phase 2: Progress Indicators

**Goal**: Users know exactly how many screenshots have been processed and how many remain
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (requires non-blocking architecture for smooth updates)
**Requirements**: PROC-02
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Add native ProgressView and completion haptic

**Success Criteria:**
1. User sees "X of Y screenshots" count during processing
2. Progress indicator updates smoothly without UI stutter
3. User receives haptic feedback when processing completes

### Phase 3: State Persistence

**Goal**: Processing results survive app termination; previously processed screenshots are skipped
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (uses non-blocking architecture)
**Requirements**: PERSIST-01, PERSIST-02, PERSIST-03, PERSIST-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Create ProcessedScreenshotStore and add Codable conformance
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Integrate persistence into ProcessingViewModel

**Success Criteria:**
1. User kills app during processing, relaunches, and sees results from before termination
2. User processes 50 screenshots, relaunches, and reprocessing skips all 50
3. User deletes source screenshots, and stale cached results are cleaned up
4. Processed screenshot IDs persist across app launches

### Phase 4: Launch Experience

**Goal**: App launches instantly with previous results visible; loading state is polished
**Depends on**: Phase 3 (requires persistence layer for cached results)
**Requirements**: LAUNCH-01, LAUNCH-02, LAUNCH-03
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Add skeleton loading UI with shimmer for results section
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Implement scroll position persistence
- [x] 04-03-PLAN.md — Wire isRefreshing flag and add background refresh (gap closure)

**Success Criteria:**
1. User launches app and immediately sees previous session's results (no loading delay)
2. User sees skeleton/placeholder UI while fresh data loads in background
3. User's scroll position from previous session is restored on launch

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Cache results list, not full app state | Simpler implementation, results are what users care about | ✓ Good |
| Leave unknown screenshots in place | User expectation — don't move things that weren't classified | ✓ Good |
| Track processed IDs, not full state | Skip duplicates without complexity of resumable processing | ✓ Good |
| Use UserDefaults for processed ID storage | Already used for corrections; consistent pattern | ✓ Good |
| Use .userInitiated QoS for OCR dispatch | User is waiting for results | ✓ Good |
| Stored Task reference for cancellation | Enables cancel button to stop processing | ✓ Good |
| Show skeleton only when isRefreshing AND results.isEmpty | Prevents flicker when cached data exists | ✓ Good |
| Save scroll position on disappear, not during scroll | Avoids excessive UserDefaults writes | ✓ Good |

**Issues Resolved:**

- UI freeze during processing (background dispatch)
- No cancel option (Task cancellation pattern)
- Unknown screenshots moved incorrectly (removed addAsset calls)
- Reprocessing on every launch (ID tracking + filtering)
- Cold launch shows nothing (cached results load)
- Gap: isRefreshing never set (added refreshInBackground method)

**Issues Deferred:**

None — all milestone requirements satisfied.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None — clean implementation with no shortcuts.
