title: Create app branding, onboarding, and iOS 26 UI

## Problem

The app needs polish before release:

1. **Logo & Branding**: Create a sticky, minimalistic logo and finalize the app name
2. **Onboarding**: Design an onboarding flow that explains the required permissions (Photos, Google/YouTube OAuth) in a clear, user-friendly way
3. **UI Refresh**: Update the interface to follow iOS 26 design guidelines

Currently the app has functional UI but lacks:
- A distinctive app icon/logo
- First-run experience explaining what the app does and why permissions are needed
- Modern iOS 26 styling (likely new visual language, spacing, components)

## Solution

TBD - Potential approach:
- Research iOS 26 HIG for new design patterns
- Create simple geometric logo that represents "sorting screenshots"
- Build 3-4 screen onboarding with permission request integration
- Audit current ProcessingView and AuthStatusView against iOS 26 guidelines
